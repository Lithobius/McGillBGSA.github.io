Hey BGSA!
 
Happy March! A few things to look out for this month. Our monthly coffee hour will be held THIS WEDNESDAY! So bring your mug and your labmates and enjoy some free coffee in the BGSA room. Also, don't forget to pay your deposits for CEEB retreat if you are going!
 
We will be holding a Spring Social/BGSA Information Night on March 31, featuring free snacks and beverages at Thomson House, as well as information about the BGSA Executive and Representative positions we will be trying to fill at our elections in April/May.  Also note that the undergraduate-run Wine and Cheese will be next Thursday March 17 in Bellini.  As always, we have our weekly writing night every Tuesday, if youâ€™re looking for some moral support and a change of scenery for some post-work hours work.
