Hi all!
not a lot on the docket this week. Feel free to email me if you have any info you'd like distributed to the BGSA 
 
**1) STATE OF THE LISTSERV**
The results are in! and we are very split :/
The consensus I get from this is to allow non-biology-related posts on the BGSA group on Facebook and the BGSAjiji doc, but not the listserv.  If you can please try and remove postings from the doc when they are no longer relevant that'd be great. I'll try and keep it updated/highlight what's on there within these weekly emails.
[ The 2 "others" were 1) keep BGSAjiji and allow on FB, and 2) allow everywhere but enact clearer rules for the listserv ]
If you have alternate analyses feel free to complain at me.

## Biology-related ads/requests/messages are still fine to be sent out on the listserv.


**2) POSITIONS AVAILABLE**
There are still PGSS and AGSEM rep positions available. Feel free to email me!


**3)sending love and tears to my fellow queers <3 **
