**BGSA R/Statistics Workshop Series Starts Monday February 6.**

  
We are excited to announced the start of the BGSA organized R/Statistics workshop Winter series! The workshops provide an excellent opportunity for graduate students to surmount the seemingly steep R learning curve and advance their statistical skills.

The Winter series, facilitated by invited graduate students and faculty,
begins Monday, February 6th 14h-16h in N4/17. It will continue weekly over ten
sessions and tentatively cover the following topics:

  * [Programming in ](https://sites.google.com/site/mcgillbgsa/workshops/programming_in_r)[R](https://sites.google.com/site/mcgillbgsa/workshops/programming_in_r)
  * Linear, generalized and additive mixed-effects models
  * Path analysis, structural equations and causal inference (invited speaker: Bill Shipley)
  * Likelihood estimation
  * Bayesian statistics
  * Time series analysis
  * Spatial statistics
