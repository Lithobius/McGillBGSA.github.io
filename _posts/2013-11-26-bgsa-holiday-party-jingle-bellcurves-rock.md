Hey BGSA! This year's Biology Holiday Party "Jingle Bell-curves Rock" will be

on Thursday December 5th at the Thompson House. Doors will open at 6pm, and

dinner will be served around 7pm. It's going to be a great night filled with

food, entertainment from your very own BGSA, and lots of dancing! Also this

year we will be holding the first ever departmental lip syncing contest! I

know we're all a very competitive bunch as was demonstrated at this year's

pumpkin carving contest so please sign up to participate (email Kiyoko with

your name and song) and bring your A-game because I know we are :D If lip

syncing is not your thing, but you still want to compete in something, there

will also be a baking contest with details on that coming soon from Dieta.

Bring all your labmates, profs, staff and significant others!! Especially this

year lets all really try to get our profs to come out like they used to in

previous years! Tickets are on sale now: $15 for Faculty and Staff (and non-

McGill) $10 for Grads and Postdocs free for children They can be purchased

from the following sellers: Stewart Bio: Claudia Wever - office N4/6; lab N4/7

Redpath Museum: Andrea Morden: office 104 (Ricciardi Lab) Bellini: Mary-Rose

Bradley-Gill - office 232; lab 270 I will also be carrying some tickets around

with me at the EEL and Organismal Seminars for the next few weeks. There's a

limited number of tickets so don't wait till the last minute because they will

sell out!!
