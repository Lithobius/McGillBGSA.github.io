Hello fellow biology enthusiasts,  
  
Do you like pumpkins?  
  
Do you enjoy craving pumpkins or other...things?  
  
If you answered "yes" to either of these questions, then boy does the BGSA
have the event for you!  
  
Now that Thanksgiving has come and gone, it's time to get jazzed about the
second greatest event in October: the Annual Biology Department Pumpkin
Carving Contest, or ABDPCC (just rolls off the tongue).  
  
For those of you new to the Department or unfamiliar with the event, teams
participating in the contest sign up in advance, and arrive the day of the
event with tools in hand, and carve the greatest pumpkin of all time. Teams
must pay 6$/team, which covers the cost of the pumpkin (which we will provide)
and prizes. Please sign-up by emailing, Rowshyra
(rowshyra{dot}castaneda{at}mail{dot}mcgill{dot}ca) and getting your team's 6$
to Rowshyra (Redpath 104A), or Katherine Velghe (Stewart Bio W6/5) or Ria Ghai
(Peterson Hall 26) by Monday October 24th so we can purchase supplies.  
Teams will have 1 hour to carve the pumpkin related to a surprise THEME that
will be announced by the surprise judges on the day of the event. Judging
criteria include: adherence to theme, creativity/originality, use of lab
tools, and participation of the lab supervisor (extra points... so convince
your prof to come!)  
  
Summary:  
  
WHAT: I think that should be obvious by now.  
WHEN: Tuesday, October 25 at 11:30 am (event is 1hr: teams should arrive 15
mins early to prepare: onlookers welcome!)  
WHERE: 4th floor lobby, Stewart Biology Building  
WHO: Graduate students, postdocs, professors, anyone in the Department with an
interest in pumpkins and/or squash carving  
WHY: Because October wouldn't be complete without a pumpkin carving contest
AND there will be prizes, and wait for it... a TROPHY (yes, a TROPHY) for the
winning team.  
DEADLINE to sign up: Monday, October 24th  
  
So start harassing your supervisors, assemble a team and contact Rowshyra to
sign-up, we're looking forward to seeing you next Tuesday, October 25th at
11:30 am for pumpkin fun! Teams, don't forget to bring your own carving
supplies.
