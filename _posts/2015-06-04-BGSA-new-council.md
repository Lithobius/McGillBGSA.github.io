**Hey BGSA,**

Thanks to everyone came out to our slightly chilly BBQ!  And a big thank you to all the BGSA councillors who helped making the event possible!

Also, June 1 was the day we changed BGSA councils. Thank you to last year's council for all the work they put in this year! If you are wondering who is involved, check out our contacts page: [http://mcgillbgsa.com/contact/](http://mcgillbgsa.com/contact/)

Please note, for the summer months, I will be reducing the BGSA weekly to once every two weeks.  There's a lot going on in the [BGSAjiji](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s9BcBibvzUni4RXZ90X5_LQtxD_19S6mxys_-VmQ1CM/edit?pli=1#gid=0) these days so make sure you keep checking it!
