### BGSA Room Update

Hey BGSA!

The Google calendar idea did not work for room booking. So I've created this free calendar that I think should do the trick.  If anyone has any alternative suggestions please let me know! For now, I am not putting a password, but if we run into any troubles (maybe randoms booking our room?) then that might be something we need to do.

So the information is updated in the attached document. This is the new website:

[http://www.brownbearsw.com/cal/BGSA-Room-Booking](http://www.brownbearsw.com/cal/BGSA-Room-Booking)

YOU ONLY NEED TO BOOK THE ROOM IF YOU NEED IT FOR A PRIVATE USE, such as Skyping or a meeting.  When you book the room, please include:

* Your name
* Your email
* The purpose

The Google doc with list of key holders and room booking link has been updated [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PWHg45l0DNsY3SJ0CzAYsUNY9Xdv4eXkx6zcgu3TZJo/edit#gid=0).

Thanks all and hope you enjoy the room!
