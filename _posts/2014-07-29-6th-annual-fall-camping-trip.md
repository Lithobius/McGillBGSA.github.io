Hello Returning Students! 

My name is Scott De Vito, I'm at PhD student in the Nilson lab and this years Biology Graduate Student Association [BGSA] Vice President.  

The BGSA is organizing the 6th annual fall camping trip to welcome new students to the department.  This is a great opportunity for both new and returning students to get to know each other outside of the university!  
We will be leaving for [Gatineau Park](http://www.ncc-ccn.gc.ca/places-to-visit/gatineau-park), just outside of Ottawa, on **Friday, September 5th** and returning on **Sunday, September 7th**.

The weekend promises to be a great time and we hope you can make it!  Feel free to check out [photos](https://plus.google.com/photos/111919271963074240179/albums?banner=pwa) of past events.
It would be great if those of you who went on previous trips would let new students know how much fun you had!

A Few Details:

1. The cost should be around 40-60 dollars for car rentals, gas, food, gear, and the site (but NOT including alcohol).  
2. This is "car camping" i.e. even if you've never been camping you're more than qualified to come.
3. There is great hiking, caving, swimming, canoe/kayak rentals, fishing, and biking (and bike rentals) in the park :)
4. We will have a section of the Google doc for gear sharing.
5. You're significant others are more than welcome, but don't feel obligated (i.e. you don't have to hire someone to pretend to be your partner :) )
6. We are vegan, vegetarian, omnivore, and carnivore friendly.
7. There are bathrooms (10 minute walk) and an outhouse (1 minute walk)
8. We've had about 30-40 people (~25% of the grad students in Biology) come on each of the last two trips! (It really does provide a great way to meet fellow students)
9. If there is anyone interested in helping in plan/organize things such as cars, food, equipment, and finances please let me know.
10. I am also looking for someone to help take deposits from Redpath and also the 6th floor Stewart. 
11. You have until **August 15th** to let fill out the form to let us know if you're interested in coming, after that, we'll only be sending email updates to people who have expressed interest.
