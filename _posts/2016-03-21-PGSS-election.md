Hey BGSA!
 
Not much to report this week except make sure you vote in the PGSS elections!  It doesn’t take long. Next week, you should check out a workshop that Sarah Finlayson is organizing with PGSS on composting! And don’t forget on Thursday the BGSA is inviting you to TH for some socializing and information on our upcoming BSGA election!

**PGSS Composting Workshop** 

- Interested in growing your own food at home, or finding ways to reduce your ecological footprint? Come learn about the amazing world of soil and compost in this hands-on workshop with Compost Montreal! During the workshop, you will learn about the web of life in the soil that helps plants grow, and the role that compost plays in that process. You will learn how to build a compost pile from scratch in your backyard, or set up a worm composting system in your apartment (don’t worry, it’s odour free!) We'll even look at compost under the microscope!  
- Bonus: You’ll be able to buy the supplies you need to start your own vermicompost!
