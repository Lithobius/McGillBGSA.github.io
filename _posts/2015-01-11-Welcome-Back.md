Hey BGSA,

Hope you're all getting back into the swing of things!  To help you along, the BGSA will be providing you with some FREE NACHOS AND BEVERAGES at Thomson House this Wednesday! Come re-connect with old friends and meet some new ones! Details below.

We have quite a few things coming up! We will be having our writing night start up again Tuesday night in the BSGA room.  If you're stuck working late or need some motivation, come work with us!  Also don't forget to come out the Equity and Diversity in the Lab Workshop next Monday. And please note that the monthly coffee hour this month that usually falls on the 2nd Wednesday of the month will be cancelled since the Welcome Back falls on that day.  We will resume next month on Feb 10!
