Hey guys!

* **WHO**: All Biology graduate students and postdocs 
* **WHAT**: BBQ (veggie and meat
options), snacks and drinks (soda and other adult beverages) 
* **WHEN**: Wednesday September 4th from 4pm till it's over or Thomson House kicks us out. 
* **WHERE**: Reservoir field, the big grassy field across from Thomson House between Dr Penfield, des Pins and McTavish
