title: "Writing Seminar Tuesday and Coffee Hour Wednesday!"
---

Hey BGSA!
 
We will be holding our monthly coffee hour **THIS WEDNESDAY** from 10AM-11AM! So bring your mug and your friends to grab some FREE COFFEE!
 
Also, there is a **WRITING SEMINAR TOMORROW**! There will also be free coffee.  Also note that in last week’s BGSA Weekly, I said the seminar was occurring at 1:00, but it should’ve said 11:00AM like the original announcement. Sorry for all the confusion.
