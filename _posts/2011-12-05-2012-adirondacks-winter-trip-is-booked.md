Hello BGSA!



  



Did that dusting of snow last month make you pine for snowshoes, skies,

snowpeople and snowball fights?! You're in luck! The 2012 BGSA Annual

Adirondacks trip has been officially booked!!!



  



Who: YOU!!!!



What: 2012 Adirondacks Trip!



When: Fri Feb 3-Sun Feb 5, 2012



Where: The gorgeous Adirondacks



  



Hopefully there will be lots of snow and we can avoid Harvard.



If you haven't been on this trip before, it's a lot of fun. The log cabin is

great, the Adirondacks are beautiful, and friends are welcome. See 2010 and

2011 photos on: [https://picasaweb.google.com/111919271963074240179?fgl=true&p

Stay tuned for more information in January regarding sign-ups, deposits, cars,

food and activities.



  



Cheers



BGSA
