Hello Biology!
 
Just a reminder tomorrow is the **BGSA Welcome Back BBQ Lunch**! I'd like to invite you to come enjoy free food and great company.
 
* **Where:** Stewart Biology Courtyard (between South and West block)
* **When:** September 3 @ 12:00-1:30PM
* **What:** Free BBQ!
 
ALSO, the Physics Department has challenged the Biology department to the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge. I'm calling all Biology students, Professors, and staff to come do this challenge with me at **1:30PM tomorrow**. If you don't know what this is, it involves recording on video the challengee as he/she dumps a bucket of ice water on their head, and **donates 10$ to the ALS Association**.  The physics department did it as a department, after being challenged by the chemistry department, and then they proceeded to challenge us. So come help me rise to the challenge and donate to the ALS Association. To participate:

Please bring your own bucket, and ice if you can We will have the hose hooked up to fill buckets with water and we will supply some ice. We will start filling buckets around 1:00PM! Alternatively, you can show up with your bucket ready to go at 1:30!

As a research intensive department, we experience first hand the impact of funding towards research.  There are many worthy causes for our charity, but I hope you will consider giving 10$ to the ALS Association today. This mass social movement has been amazing, so let's help the ball continue rolling! Also, suggestions of which department to challenge next are welcome.

Here is what we need to top:

See you all tomorrow!
