Hello BGSAers old and new!  
  
The leaves are turning, politics are simmering, and it's getting darker sooner... We all know what that means - the start of a new semester! As always, we want to welcome new students (and returning students!) with open arms and get them on the proper path to the maze that's called grad school.    

The BGSA will be holding orientation this semester on Thursday, September 6. We've got things going all day, but it will culminate in a FREE BBQ on the reservoir from 4-6pm.  
  
Here's the plan, so we'll see everyone on Thursday!  

**For new students!**

* 12:30-1:00 The Biology Department and You: A guide to graduate school at
McGill  
* 1:00-1:30 Lunch with BGSA officers  
* 1:30-2:30 Scavenger Hunt  
  
**Everyone!**  

* 4:00-6:00 FREE BBQ  
  
Cheers  
The BGSA
