Good news! The WordPress workshop has been rescheduled and it's still FREE. See below for registration instructions.  
  
Do you wish you could have your own website so you can disseminate your research, publications or pictures of you in a row boat (<http://tinyurl.com/85ry26v>)? Well then do I have some good news for you. BGSA is hosting a WordPress workshop on Friday, February 10, 2012 from 10:00-11:30 in Stewart Biology W2/3B. WordPress (<http://wordpress.org/>) is a user friendly, free, web software you can use to create your own website. Sidra Mamood (<http://www.oneseventyfive.com/>) a web designer from Toronto will guide you from inception to the publication of your very own website. And best of all, the workshop is FREE!      

Space is limited though, so if you want to attend sign-up at the following link (click or copy and paste the link): <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ ccc?key=0Am30GsVd1jhrdGFqNU9HOGpKQTZoWVJfbFJXcjNXWGc>      

If you are already signed up then your place is reserved. If you can no longer attend the rescheduled workshop please remove your name so that the space becomes available for other participants.
