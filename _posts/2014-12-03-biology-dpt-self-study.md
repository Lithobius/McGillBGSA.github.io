The BGSA is contributing to the Departmental Self-Study being prepared in advance of the upcoming Cyclical Review. To gather this information, we sent a survey to the graduate students in this department. We asked questions relating to: 
1. Application process 
2. Advisory support 
3. Teaching Opportunities 
4. Finances 
5. Departmental staff support 
6. Career preparation 
7. Quality and effectiveness of the graduate program 

The 25 responses were then summarized and grouped in a draft document outlining the pros and cons of the McGill Biology Department from a graduate student perspective.
