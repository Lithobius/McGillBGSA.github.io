Hello BGSA!

To cap off a great school year, the Biology Graduate Students Association (BGSA) is hosting a **free BBQ on Thursday June 5th beginning at 4pm**. 
We've also bought some softball equipment and will be organizing a **pick-up softball game starting at 6pm**. If you're interested in playing, please bring a glove if you have one!

* **Who**: All biology graduate students and postdocs, profs and other biology folk
* **What**: BBQ (veggie and meat options), drinks (free soda and beers at cost) & softball
* **When**: Thursday June 5th from 4-6 pm, softball from 6pm till it's over or Thomson House kicks us out.
* **Where**: Reservoir field, the big grassy field across from Thomson House between Dr Penfield, des Pins and McTavish
* **Why**: Because the food is FREE and we're lots of fun to hang out with!

This is a great way to meet new students, catch up with old friends, and kick off the summer. You don't have to be able to catch, throw or hit the ball in order to play with us! Please bring your labmates!

Hope to see you there!

Claudia, Mary-Rose and the rest of the BGSA
