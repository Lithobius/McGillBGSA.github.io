Hello BGSA Community,

The weather has turned and we are now on our way to the festive season. As such, the 7th annual BGSA winter retreat is inching closer and closer. Get out your skates, skis, snowshoes and winter attire for some classic winter fun. This year we have booked an Auberge in Eastman, QC for the weekend of February 5th-7th. (No more crossing the USA border, time saved, visas spared). It is located in the scenic Eastern Townships near lake Memphremagog.

There is a wide range of activities you can participate in over the weekend, so there will be something for everyone! Big cottage in the heart 100 hectares on the edge of a private lake. The chalet is situated on a large lot in the middle of maples. The cabin is also a 15 minute drive from [Orford](http://www.sepaq.com/pq/mor/index.dot?language_id=1) which offers [skiing](http://www.orford.com/ski/) (both XC and Downhill), snowboarding and Snowshoeing! 

If you don't have your own gear that is not a problem, there are always rental stores at the ski stations. The McGill Outdoors club also rents gear: [http://www.mcgilloutdoorsclub.ca/](http://www.mcgilloutdoorsclub.ca/). 

For those that prefer something more low key the Auberge is located close to the quaint town of Magog and a variety of hiking trails around the Eastern townships or you can always sit by the wood fire with a book, playing boardgames or building puzzles.
 
This will be a great opportunity for new students/postdocs to meet people in the department and serve as a nice winter getaway for all!
