Ecology Discussion Group is a new group for 2011 that meets every two weeks to discuss papers from the ecological literature relevant to the participants interest, or serve as a forum for discussion on methodology or theory being applied in their own work. The topics of focus are Landscape ecology, Functional ecology, Ecophylogenetics, Ecosystem services, Plant-Animal interactions, Community ecology, Invasion ecology, Deep Ecology, Systems Ecology and other things of fancy. Meetings are on the 2nd and 4th Tuesdays of every month at 14h00, with locations both at the MacDonald campus and Stewart Biology building. All are welcome to join and/or contribute. The group is coordinated by Tammy Elliott and Aaron Ball.  
  
Next meetings are:  
November 8, November 22, and December 13
