Hey BGSA,

It has come to my attention that there might be some last minute apartment hunting coming up, so don't forget to post your ads in the BGSAjiji and check it first for you apartment needs! If you have new students coming to the lab, mention it to them as they are not on our BGSA listserv yet! Also, for those of you have posted please remove your ad once it has been filled!

There will be another BGSA Weekly mid-August, and then they will resume weekly once again in September! Stay tuned for our welcome back BBQ and BGSA Camping announcements!
