Hello UseRs!  
  
We are happy to announce that the Montreal R User Group is now official. You can [join the group by visiting the meetup site](http://www.meetup.com/Montreal-R-User-Group/).  
  
The group has existed since 2010 in a narrower incarnation as the BGSA R/Stats Workshop Series. Previous workshops have featured invited facilitators on topics such as [Causal Analysis](https://sites.google.com/site/mcgillbgsa/workshops/causal- inference), [GLMs](https://sites.google.com/site/mcgillbgsa/workshops/GLMs), [GAMs](https://sites.google.com/site/mcgillbgsa/workshops/gams), [Multi-model inference](https://sites.google.com/site/mcgillbgsa/workshops/glmulti), [Phylogenetic analysis](https://sites.google.com/site/mcgillbgsa/workshops/phylogenetics), [Bayesian modeling](https://sites.google.com/site/mcgillbgsa/workshops/bayesian), [Meta- analysis](https://sites.google.com/site/mcgillbgsa/workshops/meta-analysis), [Ordination](https://sites.google.com/site/mcgillbgsa/workshops/ordination), [ Programming](https://sites.google.com/site/mcgillbgsa/workshops/programming_in _r) and [more](https://sites.google.com/site/mcgillbgsa/workshops). Our goal is to broaden the scope of the workshops to incorporate topics from a wide variety of applied fields.  
  
We are kicking off with a meetup on Monday, March 19th with a workshop on building and estimating Maximum Likelihood models and doing model selection.  
  
We look forward to seeing you at the next meetup!
