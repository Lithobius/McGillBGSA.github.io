Hello fellow biology minions!  

  

This post comes as announcements of the past, present, and very near future.

First up, the ghost of Halloween past shows how to get it done!

Congratulations to the returning champions, the Ricciardi lab, who once again,

captured first place in the annual pumpkin carving contest. This year's theme

was 'mutation' and Susan Bocti and Frank Scopelleti served as our illustrious

judges. In second place was the L. Chapman lab, and in third place was the

collaborative efforts of the Moon/Lasko/Dancourt lab!!
