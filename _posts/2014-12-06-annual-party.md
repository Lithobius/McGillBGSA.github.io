Hello BGSA members,

It’s that time of year again – the BGSA is proud to present “The Nightmare Before Christmas” Holiday Party! As is tradition, on **Dec. 10 2014** from **6PM until closing** we will be celebrating the holidays together at the Thomson House ballroom. Tickets are $10 for students and post-docs, $15 for faculty and staff (children are free!). Tickets include appetizers, a delicious dinner catered by Maison Thai (vegetarian and vegan options available), and lots of fun entertainment with friends and co-workers! We encourage fancy and/or theme-based attire. Also, we will be having the dessert contest ([N.B.C. theme is extra awesome](http://family.disney.com/recipes/jack-skellington-cookie-pops)), organized by Dieta Hanson, so start planning your masterpieces and keep an eye on your inbox to find out how to enter the contest!  

Please purchase tickets from **Leanne Elchyshyn** in Stewart Biology W6/5, **Dieta Hanson** in Redpath Museum rm 207, and **Mary-Rose Bradley-Gill** in the Bellini Building rm 232. Buy your tickets fast, as there is limited availability! 

Happy Holidays!

Andrea Morden
