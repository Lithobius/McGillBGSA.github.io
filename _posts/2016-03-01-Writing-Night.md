Hey all!
 
Thanks to Camille, we officially have a **LinkedIn** group. I still have yet to create an account, but if you are on this social media platform you should join! I will try to organize myself to get an account and post more information on the Facebook group.
 
For those of you who are not a part of the group yet, I created a BGSA Alumni Group on Facebook to help connect alumni as well as current BGSA members.  This will help us know what our fellow BGSA members go on to do, and help members network! If you haven't joined yet or know alumni to invite, check out the link:

I believe people should be allowed to request to join the group, but let me know if you have trouble accessing it.
 
Stay tuned for a BGSA event towards the end of this month!
