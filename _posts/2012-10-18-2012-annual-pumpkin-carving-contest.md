Hello fellow bio students!  

  

Feeling competitive? Ready to get into pumpkins up to your elbows? Interested

in firing those creative neuronal transfers?  

  

Well, it's about that time. It is time for the BGSA's annual pumpkin carving

contest!  

  

For those of you new to the Department or unfamiliar with the event, teams

participating in the contest sign up in advance, and arrive the day of the

event with tools in hand, and carve the greatest pumpkin of all time.  Teams

must pay 6$/team, which covers the cost of the pumpkin (which we will provide)

and prizes.   Please sign-up by visiting (with the money) Katie Pagnucco

(Redpath Room 303 on the third floor), Scott DeVito (Stewart N5/5; dial 7488),

Chelsea Chisholm (Stewart N3/5; dial 6428), Mary-Rose Bradley Gill (Bellini

232; if nobody there, look in lab 270 or call 3565), or Kate Krivy (Bellini

232; if nobody there, look in lab 270 or call 3565) by Tuesday, October 30th

so we can purchase supplies.  

  

Teams will have 1 hour to carve the pumpkin related to a surprise THEME that

will be announced by the surprise judges on the day of the event.  Judging

criteria include: adherence to theme, creativity/originality, use of lab

tools, and participation of the lab supervisor (extra points... so convince

your prof to come!)  

  

Summary:  

  

WHAT: I think that should be obvious by now.  

WHEN: Wednesday, October 31 at 11:30 am (event is 1hr: teams should arrive 15

mins early to prepare: onlookers welcome!)  

WHERE: 4th floor lobby, Stewart Biology Building  

WHO: Graduate students, postdocs, professors, anyone in the Department with an

interest in pumpkins and/or squash carving  

WHY: Because October wouldn't be complete without a pumpkin carving contest

AND there will be prizes, and wait for it... a TROPHY (yes, a TROPHY) for the

winning team.  

DEADLINE to sign up: Wednesday, October 30th  

  

So start harassing your supervisors, assemble a team and register with any of

the people listed above, we're looking forward to seeing you next Wednesday,

October 30th at 11:30 am for pumpkin fun! Teams, don't forget to bring your

own carving supplies.
