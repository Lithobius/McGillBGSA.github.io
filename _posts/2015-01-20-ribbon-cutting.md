Dear BGSA,

We would like to cordially invite you to the inauguration of our new BGSA room!

We are still in the process of deciding how it will be best used, and this depends both on access and your feedback. In the meantime, we're hoping you will come take a look, and submit your opinions on how you want to see the space used. Join us for our official ribbon-cutting event, accompanied by coffee/tea and doughnuts. Here are the details:

**When**: Friday, February 6 at 2:00PM

**Where**: BGSA Room, Stewart Biology N2/5

**What**:

* Ribbon-cutting ceremony 
* Coffee/tea and doughnuts
* Check out our room!
* BGSA member photo exhibition

## Calling All BGSA Photographers!

The walls of the new room are depressingly bare, and there must be some great field and lab work photos just sitting on your hard-drives  Here is your chance have them immortalized on the walls of the new BGSA room. They will be displayed at the inauguration, and as many as we have room for will stay up. 

We would prefer high resolution images, so ideally send them via email or dropbox to dustin.raab[_] [1] com 


## Lastly, call for couches!

Are you moving away and looking for a new home for your gently-used couch? Feel like doing a good deed and donating something for future BGSA members?  In order to reduce the amount of your BGSA money we spend on the room, we're looking for any couches in good condition that would help make our room feel more homey.  We will come pick it up! Send an email to mcgillbgsa[_] [1] com if you are interested!

See you there!

The BGSA Execs
