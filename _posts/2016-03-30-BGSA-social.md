Hey BGSA!
 
There’s a lot happening this week! Check out the PGSS Composting workshop at TH tonight (Wednesday) organized by our fellow BGSAer Sarah Finlayson.  The day after that, we have our BGSA Info Night/Spring Social so come out for some free snacks and beverages!
 
__Upcoming Events__
 
**PGSS Composting Workshop** 

- Interested in growing your own food at home, or finding ways to reduce your ecological footprint? Come learn about the amazing world of soil and compost in this hands-on workshop with Compost Montreal! During the workshop, you will learn about the web of life in the soil that helps plants grow, and the role that compost plays in that process. You will learn how to build a compost pile from scratch in your backyard, or set up a worm composting system in your apartment (don’t worry, it’s odour free!) We'll even look at compost under the microscope!  
- Bonus: You’ll be able to buy the supplies you need to start your own vermicompost!
