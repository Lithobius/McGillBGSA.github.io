Hello BGSA! 

To cap off a great school year, the Biology Graduate Students
Association (BGSA) is hosting a FREE BBQ on Tuesday May 14th at 4pm. There's
also a softball game that day at 6pm that everyone is welcome to stay for!

* **WHO**: All Biology graduate students and postdocs 
* **WHAT**: BBQ (veggie and meat
options), drinks (soda and other adult beverages) & softball 
* **WHEN**: Tuesday May
14th from 4-6 pm, softball from 6pm till it's over or Thomson House kicks us
out. 
* **WHERE**: Reservoir field, the big grassy field across from Thomson House
between Dr Penfield, des Pins and McTavish 
* **WHY**: Because the food is FREE and we're lots of fun to hang out with! 

This is a great way to meet new students, catch up with old friends, and kick off the summer. You don't have to be able to catch, throw or hit the ball in order to play with us! Please bring your labmates! Hope to see you there! 

Your friendly neighbourhood BGSA
