title: "Upcoming Events & TA go for votes!"

Hello biologists,

There's a lot coming up, so here are a few things I wanted to remind you of:
- **TA Strike vote**: AGSEM's GA is happening on Wednesday.  This is where all TAâ€™s vote on whether the TA's go on strike.  So go out and have your voice heard!
- **Coffee hour**: Come out for some free coffee and snacks this Friday in our BGSA room!
- **First year Rep elections at our GA**: Are you new this year? Want to get involved? The first year rep is a low commitment position, just need to show up to our GAs which happen 3 times a year! Forms to apply will be sent out later this week.
- **Department Day:** The Biology Department is putting together this year's Department Day! Last year it was a great success with some useful talks from Bio alumni, an interesting poster session from all the labs, and a great (free) wine and cheese!
