Hello BGSA

Well, it is that time of year again!  Thanksgiving is behind us, and we are all looking forward to the second most exciting event of October! And that is...you guessed it!  The **BGSA Annual Pumpkin Carving Contest**!!

For those of you unfamiliar with the event, teams participating in the pumpkin carving contest sign-up in advance, and arrive the day of the event with tools in hand to carve a spectacular Bio-tastic pumpkin.  Teams must pay $6/team, which covers the cost of the pumpkin (provided by us), and prizes. Please sign up by emailing Beth Nyboer (elizabeth{dot}nyboer(at)mail{dot}mcgill{dot}ca) or Angeline De Bruyns (angeline{dot}debruyns(at)mail{dot}mcgill{dot}ca) and getting your team’s $6 to them by **Friday, October 24** so we have time to purchase supplies. Teams have 1 hour to carve their pumpkin on a theme that will be provided the day of the contest.  Pumpkins will be scored by the returning judge, Frank Scopeletti (+ guest), who will size up your carving skills based on creativity, use of laboratory tools, originality, and participation of supervisor (worth extra points!!)

SO, here’s the scoop:

* **When**: Wednesday, October 29,  11:00 am – 12:00 pm
* **Where**: 4th floor Atrium, Stuart Biology Building
* **Who**: Graduate students, postdocs, professors and anyone else in the department who wants to participate
* **Why**: Because it’s October, there are lots of pumpkins around, pumpkins are better when they’re carved, and your lab could win enough candy prizes to last all of November (not to mention the pride of displaying the BGSA Annual Pumpkin Carving TROPHY!)

This event is super fun every year, and a great excuse to take a break from the craziness of fall workloads. So start assembling a team, contact Beth or Angeline to sign up (**you have 1 week!**), get your supervisor involved for those extra points, and we will see you all on October 29th, 11 am for pumpkin fun!
 
PS. Who won last year??? Can someone from the winning lab drop me (Beth) a line please?
