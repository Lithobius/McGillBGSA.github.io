Hey BGSA!
 
**THIS THURSDAY** is our chance to thank the staff for all that they do. Please bring some sort of food item to the lunch room this Thursday (just pick up a box of cookies or a bag of chips on your way to work!)  See the sign up below.

Also, I am looking for people to run this year's **Molecular Biology Student Symposium** happening on August 19.  Doesn't matter where you are in your degree, if you're just starting or have never helped out with this type of thing! It's a great experience and looks good on a CV! Please send me an email if you're interested.
