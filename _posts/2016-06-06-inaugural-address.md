Hi everyone! It's my first BGSA weekly. 
For those who don't know: I'm Logan, the new BGSA president. For the final time, I'd like to send **Mary-Rose** one last huge THANK YOU for all she's done.  She's been immensely helpful in the transition period and has done an incredible job the past two years.  I'm really excited and honored to be walking in her footsteps. The first of said steps is the BGSA weekly which I think has worked great and I intend to continue

For the summer time, there is a lot less going on, but please please don't hesitate to email me if you have suggestions or thoughts about ways to keep the department active during the summer.

__Otherwise:__

**1) COFFEE HOUR THIS WEEK**
Wednesday the 8th at 10am, BGSA room as per usual


**2) STATE OF THE LISTSERV**

I made this [poll](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1u6StFn6dY0qyYILdxHmF_k9-OuKgJxssK9rSBjTAEK8/viewform) to see how people feel about the BGSAjiji.  I know in the past there were complaints about too many people sending ads (apartments, couches, etc), but now I'm also hearing some people wishing to bring those kinds of emails back. Plus, it's unclear to me if the BGSAjiji is actually working.
We also now have the facebook group which could be a good platform for these kinds of things. 
For now, here is the [BGSAjiji](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s9BcBibvzUni4RXZ90X5_LQtxD_19S6mxys_-VmQ1CM/edit?pli=1#gid=0) as it stands

Overall, I have no idea how the BGSA as a whole feels on these matters, just a few vocal individuals, so I'm hoping the poll will help clear things up. Feel free to send me an email as well if you have any thoughts.


**3) POSITIONS AVAILABLE**
We are still looking for PGSS and AGSEM reps!  Both positions entail a monthly meeting with FREE FOOD! and limitless power. plz email me if you're feeling even a hint of interest.


**4) JAMMZZZ**
I love rocking out while I do routine data collection type stuff. i'll share my favs with you. feel free to share your favs with me
