Hello all!  

  

The Eco-Theoretic Cafe is starting back up this year.  

  

First meeting on Thursday October 13th, 11am, in W3/18.  

  

We are calling an emergency meeting. The state of theoretical ecology and

evolution dangles dangerously above a cold unapologetic ocean overfull with

ferocious data-driven sharks. When they will evolve legs and eat every last

one of us, no one can say. But without your help, it will surely come to be.

Please meet with us over coffee and apple pie, when we will pleasantly discuss

the merits (and downfalls) of logic and theory in describing life on this

planet. The idea is to basically organize a time we all can meet and to hash

out a schedule for the rest of the semester.  

  

  

The first `real' meeting will be on Monday October 17th, 11am, in W3/18. This

will likely be our regular meeting time. Mehdi Cherif (Fussmann post-doc;

http://biology.mcgill.ca/faculty/fussmann/postDocs.html) will give an

introduction to stoichiometric modeling in ecology, a topic he is currently

writing a book chapter on.
