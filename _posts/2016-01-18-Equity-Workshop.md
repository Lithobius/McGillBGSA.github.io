Hey BGSA,

Make sure you come out to the Equity and Diversity in the Lab Workshop today! See details below.

Also, GPS is giving out awards for staff and faculty, and science has a history of being under-represented.  I think it's unlikely that it's because we don't have good staff and faculty, so if you can think of anyone you think deserves the award, please send in your nominations through the GPS website:
[GPS awards page](http://www.mcgill.ca/gps/about/awards)

Award for administrative and support staff:   [Award for Excellence in Service to Graduate and Postdoctoral](http://www.mcgill.ca/gps/about/awards/service) Studies. The deadline for completed nominations for administrative and support staff is Friday, January 15, 2016.

Award for faculty members:

* Carrie M. Derick Award for Graduate Teaching and Supervision (less than 10 years of experience)
* David Thomson Award for Graduate Supervision and Teaching (more than 10 years of experience)
 
 The deadline for completed nominations for faculty members is Friday, January 15, 2016.
