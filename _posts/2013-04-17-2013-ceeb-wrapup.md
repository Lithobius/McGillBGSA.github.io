Hello CEEB Retreaters, On behalf of the 2013 organizing committee I would like
to thank all the speakers, moderators and participants for contributing to an
outstanding CEEB retreat. A number of you requested the slides from the
workshops and we have make them available on BGSA Speaker Deck account:
<https://speakerdeck.com/bgsa>  
  
 Carly Zitter also live tweeted Workshop #2. If you missed the workshop or
want to relive it you can find the transcript as on Storify here:

See you at next years retreat!  
  
PS These workshops are great for the whole department, not just CEEB!
