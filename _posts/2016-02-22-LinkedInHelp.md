Hey all!

I am looking for a volunteer familiar with **LinkedIn** to figure out how we can use this platform to connect BGSA alumni and current BGSA members. I still have yet to create an account, but I think this will be useful to use in addition to our recently created BGSA Alumni Facebook Group.  So let me know if you would be interested in helping BGSA members network! 

For those of you who are not a part of the group yet, I created a BGSA Alumni Group on Facebook to help connect alumni as well as current BGSA members.  This will help us know what our fellow BGSA members go on to do, and help members network! If you haven't joined yet or know alumni to invite, check out the link:
[https://www.facebook.com/groups/1731377413748940/?ref=bookmarks](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1731377413748940/?ref=bookmarks)
I believe people should be allowed to request to join the group, but let me know if you have trouble accessing it.

Besides that, not much else to report!
