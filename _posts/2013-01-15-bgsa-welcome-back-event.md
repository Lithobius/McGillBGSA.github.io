BGSA,  



  



Not sure what to do this Thursday? Please refer to the attached decision map

the BGSA officers have created for you.



  



All models suggest you attend the 2013 BGSA Welcome Back event this Thursday

at Thomson House from 5-7pm. The BGSA will be providing snacks, beverages and

the First Annual Masterpiece crafts competition. Where we give you a picture

like

any combination of lab, friends, enemies from popsicle sticks, glue and some

pipe cleaners with prizes for the best interpretation as judged by a panel.

All you have to bring is a good time and your lab mates.  



  



Come catch up with me, other graduate students, faculty and meet new people.



  



See you Thursday,



Monica



BGSA President
