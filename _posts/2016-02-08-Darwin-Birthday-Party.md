Hey BGSA,

It was an amazing winter retreat! Thanks to the organizers, food leaders, and everyone participated! Don't forget to check out the photos and lost-found via emails and dropbox. 

Our monthly coffee hour will return this Wednesday.  There will be **FREE COFFEE AND TIMBITS**.  So grab your lab mates and supervisors and come on down anytime between 10-11 on Wednesday!

Also, it is **Charles Darwin's birthday** this Friday! So to celebrate, we will be gathering in the basement of Thomson House (not the main room though, the room on the right), just to hang out and drink to a pivotal historical figure! There will be cake.
