Hello BGSA and affiliates,

Some [holiday traditions](http://www.thestar.com/news/world/2014/11/15/60_arrested_in_black_pete_protest_in_netherlands.html) are probably best left in the past.  But the **BGSA Holiday Party Baking Competition** is not one of them, and it continues on this year stronger than ever.  

Last year, David Ross and Emily Bamforth walked away with the top prizes for Regular and Specialty categories, respectively, and are still to this day basking in the glory of their triumph.  

If you too would like a piece of this eternal veneration (or, if that doesn’t interest you, there are also PRIZES), your first step would be to sign up on the [google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10Zz3w2RSh-DT-X_EexEK6eqswIVO4t3z-Bn2KLt3aoc/edit?usp=sharing),  including in which category you will be competing, and the general form your entry will take (cookie, bar, cake, etc.).  Second step would be to either bake the best entry, or to pay off your friends to vote for you*.

Ready, get set, BAKE!
