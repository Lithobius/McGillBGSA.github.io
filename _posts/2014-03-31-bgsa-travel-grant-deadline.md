Hey BGSA! This is a reminder about the BGSA travel grant. Itâ€™s due a week from

Wednesday, on April 9! Attached is the form you need to fill out. Here is a

reminder of the details: BGSA Travel Grant The grant is $400 and can be used

for conferences falling between September 1st, 2013 and August 31th, 2014. If

you've already attended a conference within that time frame, the grant may be

used retroactively. For more details and policies, please see the second page

of the application, attached here or available available on the BGSA website,

in the "Grants" section: mcgillbgsa.weebly.com To apply, please fill out the

application and return it to me, Mary-Rose, via email (preferable) or by

printing it and dropping it off to me in Bellini room 232 or lab 270.

Applications are due April 9th, and a list of winners will be drawn randomly

on April 11th and announced that day by email. The grant will be offered to

the first person on the list (first name drawn), but in the event that this

person declines the grant or becomes ineligible, it will be offered to the

next person on the list, and so on until either the award is claimed or the

award period ends. Winners must accept or decline the award by April 30th.

Please contact me if you have any questions or concerns Good luck! Mary-Rose
