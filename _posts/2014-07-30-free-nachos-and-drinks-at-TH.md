Hey BGSA!

Without softball this summer there has been a lack of BGSA gatherings. Therefore, we would like to invite you all to **Thomson House** next **Wednesday August 6** for some free nachos and some limited free drinks! Here are the details:

* What: A biologist gathering
* When: Wednesday, August 6 from 5:00-7:00PM
* Where: Thomson House Basement
* Why: Because free food and we're pretty cool to hang out with!

Don't come too late or you might miss out on the free food! Pass on the message to any new students who have started to arrive.

Sincerely,
Your friendly neighbourhood BGSA
