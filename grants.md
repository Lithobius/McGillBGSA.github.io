# BGSA Intramural Grant (max $150)

All you have to do is play an intramurals sport with other BGSA members (or mostly BGSA members). Your team can apply for up to $150 to offset the cost of your intramurals fees.

If you don’t know of a team, but you want to play on one with other BGSA members, contact Jasmin Hanafi, email jasmin{dot}hanafi{at}mail{dot}mcgill{dot}ca

All intramural sports are men’s, women’s and co-rec except ball hockey, which is only men’s. It’s a fun way to meet new people, work out some thesis-related stress, and keep fit.
