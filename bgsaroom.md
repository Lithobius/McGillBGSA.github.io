Our BGSA room is a mix of lounge and work space.  We have a couple of couches as well as desks and chairs.  This room is available to all BGSA members, to either (A) book for a specific purpose or (B) to just drop in to relax or do some work away from your office/lab. If this is something that interests you, you should contact your nearest key holder to find out how you can use the room.


## (A)	To book the room


You can book the room for:

* Skype interview/conversation
* Quiet space to practice a presentation
* Nursing
* TA office hours
* A meeting
* Etc


To book the room:


1.	Fill in the google calendar with: your name, e-mail to reach you at, and purpose of the booking.

2.	Contact your nearest key holder and arrange to borrow the key or for them to let you in. If this is not convenient, we can leave your name with the porter during daytime hours.


**(B)	To drop in**

If you would just like to drop in and use it as a relaxing space:

1.	Make sure that the room is not booked (or at least be ready to clear out of the room if itâ€™s booked).

2.	Locate your nearest key holder and arrange to borrow the key or for them to let you in.

We will try to keep the room stocked with coffee and tea, as well as creamer and sugar.  You are welcome to make coffee and/or tea, but *please remember to clean up after yourselves*.  Wet coffee grounds sitting in the coffee maker can attract unwanted pests. If anything runs out, please notify us as soon as possible at mcgillbgsa{at}gmail{dot}com.

Overall, we really want to make our room as accessible as we can with only limited amounts of keys.  If you think you could use the room but not sure how, just contact one of the key holders!
