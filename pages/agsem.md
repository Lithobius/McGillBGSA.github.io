# October 15th Meeting Minutes
TA Meeting (5:30-6:30) and All-Units Meeting (6:30-7:30)

## Unionization Drive - Want to be an AGSEM member?
If you have worked in any non-unionized Teaching Support position at McGill (for e.g. as a Grader), you can join AGSEM by signing a membership card. Once enough people (50%) sign cards, an accredited union can be formed.

More information can be found here: [http://agsemcampaign.wordpress.com/](http://agsemcampaign.wordpress.com/).

You can contact your BGSA AGSEM Delegates, Sunci and Andrea if you wish to sign a card and become a member.

## TA Bargaining Update

The Bargaining Committee has been meeting with McGill and so far only non-monetary issues have been discussed.
McGill agreed to changes proposed by AGSEM to the article on disciplinary measures, to clarify how disciplinary procedures should be conducted and ensure that an employee who is dismissed must receive either notice of dismissal or payment. AGSEM agreed to no longer require the departments to be responsible for ensuring that TAs have signed AGSEM membership forms. AGSEM will also continue to publish public updates on the Bargaining Committeeâ€™s progress in negotiations.

A summary of the changes to our collective agreement mandated by the General Assembly are on the website:
