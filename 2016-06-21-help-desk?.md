HI ALL
gl getting work done instead of hangin out in litchfield

** 1) Help Desk **
An idea was brought forward to me that the BGSA could set up some kind of computational help desk (which is being done in other departments).  Basically, if you'd be willing to hang out for a drop-in hour in the BGSA room every once in a while, where people could come by for help on something that you know something about. The initial thought was mostly for help with stats in R or Python, but there are certainly many other areas that could be useful (managing data, databases, design of figures/presentations, citation management, etc etc etc).  
If this is something that you're at all interested in, please put your name and the areas you'd be willing to help out: FORM HERE
this is definitely non-binding, just a way to gauge general interest/topics that would be covered.


** 2) Short survey about academic seminars **
Brought to us by Aerin Jacob:
Researchers Alecia Carter, Dieter Lukas, Gillian Sandstrom, and Alyssa Croft would like to understand why academics choose to participate—ask questions or not—during academic seminars. 

Students or academics at any career stage are invited to take [their quick survey](http://goo.gl/xida3O). It will take 5-10 min to complete and your answers will be anonymous. 

** 3) BGSAjiji **
