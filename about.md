#What do we do?
The Biology Graduate Students Association is the students group for all graduate students in Biology. We organize social events such as wine and cheeses and graduate student retreats, as well as educational and research events such as symposia and workshops.

#Who is a part of BGSA? 
All graduate students within Biology are members of the BGSA. To meet your fellow students and find out more about what they are doing, check the Graduate Contact List.
